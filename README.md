## Project Name: Cheshire Car Shop (Django project)  
This is a website for a fictional company called Cheshire Car Shop. It is a car sales website using Django as a back end. The index page shows the cars in stock, when a user clicks on one of these cars they are taken to a details page showing details about the car. The administrator can upload information and an image about the cars. The data is then dynamically rendered using Django.
